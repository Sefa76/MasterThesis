The chief result, that a galaxy{\textquoteright}s distance is proportional to its redshift, is so well known and so deeply embedded into the language of astronomy through the Hubble diagram, the Hubble constant, Hubble{\textquoteright}s Law, and the Hubble time, that the article itself is rarely referenced. Even though Hubble{\textquoteright}s distances have a large systematic error, Hubble{\textquoteright}s velocities come chiefly from Vesto Melvin Slipher, and the interpretation in terms of the de Sitter effect is out of the mainstream of modern cosmology, this article opened the way to investigation of the expanding, evolving, and accelerating universe that engages today{\textquoteright}s burgeoning field of cosmology.},

	abstract = {Two neutron stars merging together generate a gravitational wave signal and have also been predicted to emit electromagnetic radiation. When the gravitational wave event GW170817 was detected, astronomers rushed to search for the source using conventional telescopes (see the Introduction by Smith). Coulter et al. describe how the One-Meter Two-Hemispheres (1M2H) collaboration was the first to locate the electromagnetic source. Drout et al. present the 1M2H measurements of its optical and infrared brightness, and Shappee et al. report their spectroscopy of the event, which is unlike previously detected astronomical transient sources. Kilpatrick et al. show how these observations can be explained by an explosion known as a kilonova, which produces large quantities of heavy elements in nuclear reactions.Science, this issue p. 1556, p. 1570, p. 1574, p. 1583; see also p. 1554On 17 August 2017, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and the Virgo interferometer detected gravitational waves (GWs) emanating from a binary neutron star merger, GW170817. Nearly simultaneously, the Fermi and INTEGRAL (INTErnational Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory) telescopes detected a gamma-ray transient, GRB 170817A. At 10.9 hours after the GW trigger, we discovered a transient and fading optical source, Swope Supernova Survey 2017a (SSS17a), coincident with GW170817. SSS17a is located in NGC 4993, an S0 galaxy at a distance of 40 megaparsecs. The precise location of GW170817 provides an opportunity to probe the nature of these cataclysmic events by combining electromagnetic and GW observations.},

abstract = {MontePython is a parameter inference package for cosmology. We present the latest development of the code over the past couple of years. We explain, in particular, two new ingredients both contributing to improve the performance of Metropolis–Hastings sampling: an adaptation algorithm for the jumping factor, and a calculation of the inverse Fisher matrix, which can be used as a proposal density. We present several examples to show that these features speed up convergence and can save many hundreds of CPU-hours in the case of difficult runs, with a poor prior knowledge of the covariance matrix. We also summarize all the functionalities of MontePython in the current release, including new likelihoods and plotting options.}
